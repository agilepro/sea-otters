<h1>Where is my Child's Name?</h1>
<hr>

<p>Not all the swimmers names are presented on these pages.
Names like 'OtterXXX' are aliases for swimmers that have not given
us a request to be included by name in the page -- these are the
aliases assigned by default.</p>

<p>These score pages are provided by the scoring desk team.  At some point, someone
raised concerns about children's names being listed on the
internet.  In 2003 the league made a ruling that children's names
will not be listed on the internet without their parent's permissions.</p>

<p>Should you be concerned about your child's scores being listed?
Normally the internet issue
 centers around listing a child's address or phone number --
ways to contact or locate the child.  We don't list here
any child's address, email address, phone number, or any other
contact information.  The only information
about the child is their approximate age and their swimming times.
It is hard to see how this could lead to a threatening situation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we respect people's desire for privacy, and so
we have set up an "opt-in" policy.
If you wish your child's name to appear here, you must explicitely
tell Keith Swenson or John Mingione.  You can have your child's
scores be displayed with any name you choose, even an alias or pet-name.
Send email to 'kswenson@us.fujitsu.com' and let me know exactly
what name you want to use for your child.  Once you have done so,
you will be able to check the progress of your child over the
course of the season with ease from the comfort of your own web browser.</p>
